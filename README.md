###from letter to picture

######About
In this project I am trying to translate the different layout types of letters to artificial coded  pictures.

######first analog version
I asked people to follow these steps:  

	- take a white DIN-A4 paper
	- paint with your finger a crescent on the lower half of the paper
	with its opening to the top of the paper with a color of your desire
	- write a letter, the date in red, the addressee in blue and the sender in green;
	the rest with a pen, but use instead of words and numbers irregular wavy lines
and I got results like these:

######second analog version
I asked people to follow these steps:  

	- take a white DIN-A4 paper
	- paint with a wax crayon in turquoise on the lower half of the paper
	a non-filled rectangle (2:1)
	- fill with turquoise if you're happy the lower half,
	if you're unhappy the upper half of this rectangle;
	if you're neither happy nor unhappy, draw a filled rectangle
	centered in the non-filled rectangle with the same width, but only the half height
	- if you're either happy or unhappy, draw two filled triangle
	starting each in an empty edge of the non-filled rectangle
	to the filled rectangle in 45° and than to closest side of the non-filled rectangle
	- write a letter above these forms, but draw instead of the date a darkgreen filled
	rectangle, instead of the addressee a lightblue non-filled rectangle,
	instead of the sender a darkblue non-filled rectangle,
	write the rest of the letter in lightgreen, but use instead of words straight lines
	- draw in each blue rectangle an filled ellipse with the color of your iris
and I got results like these:

######Demo
The three rectangles symbolize the areas of the date, green, addressee, blue,  and the sender, violet.  
The startpositions of these rectangles depend on the probability for being there in normal kinds of letter layouts.  
The different movements symbolize the many different kinds of writing a letter.
