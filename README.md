###from letter to picture

######About
In this project I am trying to translate the different layout types of letters to artificial coded  pictures.
 
 
######first analog version
I asked people to follow these steps:  

	- take a white DIN-A4 paper
	- paint with your finger a crescent on the lower half of the paper with its opening to the top of the paper with a color of your desire
	- write a letter, the date in red, the addressee in blue and the sender in green; the rest with a pen, but use instead of words and numbers irregular wavy lines
and I got results like these:

######Demo
The three rectangles symbolize the areas of the date, green, addressee, blue,  and the sender, violet.  
The startpositions of these rectangles depend on the probability for being there in normal kinds of letter layouts.  
The different movements symbolize the many different kinds of writing a letter.
